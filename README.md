# Classification-Problem

In this project, we created a model that can predict whether patients have heart disease or not based on their clinical parameters. We utilized the following libraries:

* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Sklearn

We applied K-Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest Classifier to the data. Afterward, we evaluated the performance of our models and picked the best one, which is the Logistic Regression model.

The original data came from the Cleavland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
